Toolrunner Documentation
======================================

Toolrunner is a small python module created to automate commands/tools, collect their respective outputs into one place, 
and generally expedite the "initial triage" phase of malware analysis. Configurations can be loaded from or saved to python 
dictionaries, making it easy to switch between whatever sets of tools are most applicable to the situation.
